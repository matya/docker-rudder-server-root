# Open Source Automation & Compliance
This is the unofficial dockerized version of a Rudder Root server, built on ubuntu:latest via Docker.

*This is still considered a Beta build, do not use in production!*

Currently it is only a Proof-of-Concept, and is still lacking some major features and testing.

You can, however, start and run a vanilla rudder-server-root and test it before you deploy it as decriben in the Documentation at the [Rudder Site](http://www.rudder-project.org/site/documentation/)

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
